# Advent of Code Day 24 - Rust Version
[Link to Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Again the Rust version of my Python solution. This time there are no test
cases because to solve efficiently the solution is tailored for the specific
input data. So it can not work with the test cases. To get the debug output
one hast to run with environment variables RUST_LOG=debug, for simply the
solution RUST_LOG=info.
